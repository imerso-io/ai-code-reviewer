# ![a code reviewer by AI (2)](https://github.com/imerso-io/octopulls-reviewer-poc/assets/125743142/85fbc14f-60f9-4c04-8615-bcf376df3fef)

# 🐙 Octopulls, this POC shows how AI acts as a reviewer.

## Why Octopulls?
#### **Efficiency in the Review Process**
- Automating the generation of code summaries and reviews can save developers and reviewers valuable time, allowing them to focus on more complex issues that require human intervention.
#### **Consistency in Reviews**
- AI can provide a level of consistency in code reviews that is difficult to achieve with reviews done exclusively by humans, especially in large teams.
#### **Continuous Learning**
- Over time, AI can be trained to identify common error patterns or poor coding practices, making it a learning tool for developers.
